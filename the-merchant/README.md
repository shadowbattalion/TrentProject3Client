# The Merchant

## Summary

This project is where users can share their paranormal encounters with others, by uploading their encounter information and image of the paranormal on our website.

The purpose of this project is to create an online store to sell online games to avid gamers. There are two parts to the project, the backend and the frontend. The backend caters to the vendor who can manage the game product list and orders. The frontend caters to the general public, especially gamers who wish to buy online games. The cart system is implemented in order to facilitate easy browsing and buying of games. The checkout system is also implemented using Stripe to facilitate the transactions between the user and the vendor.

<ins>Motivation</ins>

This project takes inspiration from websites like Origin and Steam. They are however, not a local company. As a result, promotion and marketing events are not done locally. This project seeks to bring the online gaming market to the locals to make it easier to buy online games. This project seeks to establish a local brand name for the online gaming market and  a go-to place for Singaporeans to buy games.

In the 7 billion people that exists in the world, the number of people buys the product from Steam or Origin numbers only in the tens of thousands. This means that there is a huge market out there that local business are not really tapping on.

Based on this news, https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/singapore-sets-sights-on-becoming-world-force-in-e-sports, this market would be a win for us.
